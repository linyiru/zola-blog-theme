When I saw Leetcode on the timeline, I thought you guys were so "cult"...

Until I started doing Leetcode problems myself - "Damn it's super fun just to solve the problems, the daily intellectual challenge is the new fun every day!"

So now I'm starting to save [these algorithm problems'](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) solutions to [here](https://github.com/theowenyoung/blog/tree/main/content/algorithms).

I solve these problems in Typescript , and add a few unit tests with Deno, perfect! Don't know if I'll ever get the chance to do the whole thing in this lifetime.

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:theowenyoung/blog.git
deno test
```
