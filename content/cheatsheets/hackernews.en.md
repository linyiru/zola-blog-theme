##  How to unban Hacker News IP blocking?


HN has a hair trigger about banning IPs that request too fast. 

Fortunately, they have a self helping tool, you can unblock your ip by visit the following url (replace your ip address):

`http://news.ycombinator.com/unban?ip=<ip address>`

> Of course, you should visit it with another ip, cause your ip has been banned, try to change to another wifi, or use your mobile phone network.
