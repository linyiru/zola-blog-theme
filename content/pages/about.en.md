I created a personal public Wiki [Everything I Know by Owen - A Personal Knowledge Based Wiki (owenyoung.com)](https://wiki.owenyoung.com/) and Blog [Home - Owen Young's Story](https://blog.owenyoung.com/), which made me develop the habit of taking notes and writing more things, because the habit has been formed, so I no longer bothered about the form of the blog, put my personal notes, all the output of the blog through here, so that I can better maintain myself and save my mind, before the two places I was a little overwhelmed by switching back and forth.

I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit all the content of this blog. Obsidian has a lot of easy-to-use shortcuts to make writing more efficient, and I recommend you use them as well. I prefer text-assisted input tools to software that modifies the formatting of my original data. It gives me more control as well as not being locked in by the operator.

I'm using [Zola (getzola.org)](https://www.getzola.org/) to generate this static blog, Zola is written in Rust, before that I basically used JS toolchain to generate the blog, now I prefer to use the one-stop tool, mainly because I'm afraid of the third-party plugin ecosystem, and I want to keep my blog as simple as possible. Zola actually provides a lot of capabilities, so it can also achieve most of the ideas, for example, I implemented this book sorting by rating: [books-sort-by-rating](content/pages/books- sort-by-rating.md)

Now , I'am using [foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) and [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit the wiki.

## About Me

### A failure of English learning

I've learned English more than 10 years, but it still sucks, so I registered a Twitter [@TheOwenYoung](https://twitter.com/TheOwenYoung) for only English tweets, and this [wiki](https://wiki.owenyoung.com) and [blog](https://blog.owenyoung.com) to force me to use more English.

### Programmer
