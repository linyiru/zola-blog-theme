## Quotes

> Q: Why should your right to freedom of speech trump a person's right not to be offended?

> A: In order to think, you have to risk being offensive. You're using your free speech to risk offending me and more power to you!
>
> -- [Jordan B. Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wLCmDtCDAM)
